About us
========

The United Engineering Group is team of likeminded engineers and IT people, who want
to take `DUAL Universe <http://www.dualthegame>`_ to the next level.

In a universe so massive and big, there is an inherent need for order.
People within the universe want to be able to cooperate and build structures, machines and ships
together.

Our goal
--------

Imagine flying through space and meeting someone completely new. He has beautifull structures and clever designs within his ship. But you can't use them at all, because you both have completely different architectures and thoughts about how to create all.

And this is exactly where the United Engineering Group steps in.
We create design and architectures for all areas within DUAL. From the motors of a small ground based vehicle to the massive hangars on a tender ship or shipyards on a spacestation. We think about it and define standards.
Interfaces anybody can use and build ontop.

From easy to understand form factors for a swapeable engine to the software architecture of a drone or production facility. Anybody can come to us for help and aid. And if he gets through our trainings and courses, he is a united engineer. And can be sure, if he meets another one, they are able to interact and profit from these guidelines.

Because united we are better defined.


How we achieve it
-----------------

As stated, we are trying to think about design and compatibility on massive scale.
We create interfaces and basic blueprints for almost everything. 

We are seeking aliances and cooperations with the major factions within the game. The bigger your community is, the more problems you can get without standards.
